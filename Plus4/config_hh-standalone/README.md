# HH STANDALONE

The goal of this config is to have a configuration that uses Happy Hare as much as possible. In this way we have access to all the advanced features of Happy Hare and can configure the printer to our liking via mmu configuration files.

Warning - gcodes for this config differ from Qidi's stock box gcode.

## STATUS

Work in progress - should work, bugs to be expected

## INSTALLATION

1. Replace your bunnybox_macros.cfg with the one in this folder.

2. Replace your mmu folder with the one in this folder.

3. In the slicer, set your profile to use the machine gcodes [following g-codes](slicer_machine_gcodes_hh.md)
