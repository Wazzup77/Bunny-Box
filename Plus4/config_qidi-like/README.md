# HH STANDALONE

The goal of this config is to have a configuration as close to stock Qidi Box as possible - being transparent for the slicer, screen and other components. In this manner we can use the Box with minimal changes outside of installation of Happy Hare.

The advantage is that we can use the Box with minimal changes outside of installation of Happy Hare - it is thus recommended for users who don't want to learn Happy Hare.

## STATUS

Work in progress - not ready yet, use at your own risk.
